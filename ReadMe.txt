We have four error checkings:

1.If the user want to download the file from the server which is not exist, there will be error message.
2.If the user want to upload some file which is not exist on the client, there will be error message.
3.If the file is already exist , and we want to upload or download it, there will be asking for overwriting.
4.If the user want to overwrite, we will delete the old file and create a new one.
